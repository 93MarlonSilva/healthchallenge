  "productCodeDescription": "The Hidrolight Splint Bilateral Orthosis is made of Plush neoprene, with thermal insulating properties and an elegant plush finish. It has wide adjustment capacity due to the fabric's adherence. At rest, the orthosis is pre-adjusted, with thumb closure and an elastic membrane that works as a pocket, facilitating placement by the patient themselves. The internal splints are easily adjustable to adapt to the desired hand. Two removable splints are provided, one with an ideal curvature to support the wrist to the palm of the hand, and the second straight on the dorsal part of the wrist, preventing up and down movements. The adherent elastic wraps around the joint, providing compression according to medical indication and patient need.",
